These are patches for x264, a software H.264/AVC encoder.
They should be applied to the unmodified source revision contained in their filename, not in a combined fashion, ie. apply 1.0 or 1.1, not 1.0 and then 1.1.

See the x264 project's site for more information on it: http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html

The revision these patches apply to is in the filename. At present the revision we're working with, and thus creating patches for, is e381f6d.

For a full guide to setting up x264 to run in the OpenRISC architectural simulator, see the forum post here: http://opencores.org/forum,OC%20H.264%20project,0,3557

The following is a quick guide to getting the x264 source, reverting to the correct revision, and then applying a patch (patches are unified, not progressive.)

1. Get x264 sources from git repository

# git clone git://git.videolan.org/x264.git

2. Revert to the appropriate revision

# cd x264
# git checkout e381f6d

3. Patch the x264 source (while within the x264 directory)

# patch -p1 < ../oc-h264-encoder/trunk/x264/patches/x264-e381f6d-or32-or1ksim-with-fp-1.0.patch

The x264 source code is now patch, and can be configured and compiled. Check the OpenCores h.264 project forum for more details: http://opencores.org/forum,OC%20H.264%20project
