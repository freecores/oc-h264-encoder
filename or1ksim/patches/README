These are patches for or1ksim, aimed at customising it for the development of an x264 port/hardware adaption.


For details on applying the patches, see the entire or1ksim/x264 setup guide in the OpenCores H.264 project forum: http://opencores.org/forum,OC%20H.264%20project,0,3557

An outline of the basic steps follows:
# wget ftp://ocuser:oc@orsoc.se/toolchain/or1ksim-0.3.0.tar.bz2
# tar xjf or1ksim-0.3.0.tar.bz2
# wget ftp://ocuser:oc@orsoc.se/toolchain/or1ksim-0.3.0-fp-patch.bz2
# cd or1ksim-0.3.0
# bzcat -dc ../or1ksim-0.3.0-fp-patch.bz2 | -patch -p1
# ./configure --target=or32-elf --prefix=/opt/or32-newlib
# make all install

or1ksim-0.3.0-fp.patch.bz2

Patch for or1ksim-0.3.0 implementing floating point (single precision) support to the simulator, as well as tweaking its boot address to start from 0x100 instead of 0xf0000100.

or1ksim-0.3.0-fp-sadssdmod.patch.bz2

Patch to be applied ontop of or1ksim-0.3.0-fp.patch.bz2, implementing an example SAD/SSD calculation module in the video_enc/ subdirectory. It is a little large because each time a subdirectory is added to or1ksim each automake and autoconf file must be updated.
